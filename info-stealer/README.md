Wanted to know how infostealers work so did some research and decided to make a basic one

Right Now it can only do  

    - Steal the most recent 50 Urls in History along with visit count  
    - Steal Emails/Username And decrypt chrome passwords   
    - Store Them into a file  
Although i cant get the decryption working properly as its adding unwated characters

Plan to add  
    
    - Steal Cookies and session tokens  
    - Steal Autofill Data and What i can get from Credit Card info   
    - Basic CryptoWallet Stealing  
    - Computer Infomation (OS version, Ram, Public Ip and so on)  
    - Send The Infomation To a C2 server, Using HTTP/HTTPS Maybe Using DNS if i can be fucked researching into doing that for C
